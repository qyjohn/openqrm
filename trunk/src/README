openQRM is the next generation, open-source Data-center management platform.
Its fully pluggable architecture focuses on automatic, rapid- and appliance-based
deployment, monitoring, high-availability and especially on supporting and
conforming multiple virtualization technologies. 
openQRM is a single-management console for the complete IT-infra structure and
provides a well defined API which can be used to integrate third-party tools as
additional plugins.

Its goal is it to archive the following specifications :

- KIS (keep it simple)
- run everywhere (support for every linux distribution, especially Debian+Ubuntu)
- clean up (remove all not needed code)
- reduce code base (less code = less bugs)
- using existing components (instead of providing own binaries/libs)
- better packaging and dependencies
- enabling/disabling plugins via the GUI
- support for multiple databases (db2, mysql, oracle, postgres)
- porting from java to php
- focusing on virtualization
- removing the installer-stage, do the inititialization during firststart
- ... and some more

Please feel free to contribute to this project with your own ideas and code.
