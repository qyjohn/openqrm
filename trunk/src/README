This is an openQRM development project.

Its goal is it to archive the following improvements compared
to current stable openQRM branch :

- KIS (keep it simple)
- run everywhere (support for every linux distribution, especially Debian+Ubuntu)
- clean up (remove all not needed code)
- reduce code base (less code = less bugs)
- using existing components (instead of providing own binaries/libs)
- better packaging and dependencies
- enabling/disabling plugins via the GUI
- support for multiple databases (db2, mysql, oracle, postgres)
- porting from java to php
- focusing on virtualization
- removing the installer-stage, do the inititialization during firststart
- ... and some more

Please feel free to contribute to this project with your own
ideas and code.
