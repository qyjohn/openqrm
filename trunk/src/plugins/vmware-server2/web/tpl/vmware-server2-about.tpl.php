<br>
VMware Server 2 is known to be a great choice for applications which require a full-virtualization technology.
 VMware-server Virtualization hosts can be easily provisioned via openQRM by enabling this plugin. It also enables the administrator
 to create, start, stop and deploy the 'vms' seamlessly through the web-interface. The virtual VMware-server-resources (vms) are then
 transparently managed by openQRM in the same way as physical systems.

<br>
<b>How to use :</b>
<br>

<ul>
<li>
Create an appliance and set its resource-type to 'VMware-Server2 Host'
</li><li>
Use the 'VMware Server 2 Manager' in the VMware Server 2 plugin menu to create a new VMware virtual-machine on the Host
</li><li>
The created VMware vm is then booting into openQRM as regular resources
</li>
</ul>
