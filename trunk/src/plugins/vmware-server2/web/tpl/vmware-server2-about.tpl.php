<strong>This plugin is tested with VMware-server-2.0.1-156745.i386</strong>
<br>
<br>
VMware Server 2 is known to be a great choice for applications which require a full-virtualization technology.
 VMware-server Virtualization hosts can be easily provisioned via openQRM by enabling this plugin. It also enables the administrator
 to create, start, stop and deploy the 'vms' seamlessly through the web-interface. The virtual VMware-server-resources (vms) are then
 transparently managed by openQRM in the same way as physical systems.
