Xen is known to be a great choice for applications which require a para-virtualization technology.
Xen Virtualization hosts can be easily provisioned via openQRM by enabling this plugin. It also enables the administrator
to create, start, stop and deploy the 'vms' seamlessly through the web-interface. The virtual Xen-resources (vms) are then
transparently managed by openQRM in the same way as physical systems.

<br>
<b>How to use :</b>
<br>
<ul>
<li>
Create an appliance and set its resource-type to 'Xen Host'
</li><li>
Use the 'Xen Manager' in the Xen menu to create a new Xen virtual-machines on the Host
</li><li>
The created Xen vm is then booting into openQRM as regular resources
</li>
</ul>
