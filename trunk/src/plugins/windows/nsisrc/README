This directory contains the sources for the Windows openQRM Client.
The openQRM Client is made with the Open-Source Nullsoft Installer.
To compile the openQRM Client please follow the steps below :

1) run "bash ./get-components.sh"
  This will download additional components needed for the openQRM Client installer such as :
  - CopSsh
  - Wget.exe
  - Sleep.exe

2) Copy or mount this dir on a Windows system
3) Install the Nullsoft Installer
4) Right-click on the "openQRM-Client.nsi" file and choose "compile"

=> this will generate a new openQRM-Client-VERSION-setup.exe

How to integrate Windows systems into openQRM via this windows client is explained
in the Windows plugin About page.

Please notice !
Make sure to run "bash ./clean-components.sh" before commiting in this directory.
