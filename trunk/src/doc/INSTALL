How to build and install openQRM

To build please run :

	make

-> this automatically checks the requirements for the compilation
-> it builds the base server and plugins
-> it will download and compile some third-party components
-> it will cache downloads and compile results
-> build-location can be configured in ../src/etc/openqrm-server.conf

To install run :

	make && make install

-> this installs openQRM-ng
-> install-location can be configured in ../src/etc/openqrm-server.conf
	
To start run :

	make start

-> this basically just runs "/etc/init.d/openqrm start"
-> installation phase is not needed any more and got eliminated
-> initialization happens automatically on first-start
-> initialization automatically checks for runtime-requirements

To check the install requirements run :

	make check

-> this checks the requirements for the compilation
-> if this checks fails it will display the exact missing package requirement
   Then just install the listed package via apt-get/yum/.. and try again.

To package (rpm/deb) run :

	make package

-> this automatically build .deb or .rpm packages
-> package location can be configured in ../src/etc/openqrm-server.conf

To reinstall e.g. after making changes to the sources run :

	make reinstall

-> this runs stop, uninstall, clean, all, install, start

Please notice that all make-targets (especially "install") should be executed as root.

After compiling and installing openQRM-ng it automatically
initialises itself during first-start according the configuration
parameters set in the main (and single) configuration file BASEDIR/openqrm/etc/openqrm-server.conf

The openQRM-server is now ready for login at : http://[ip-of-the-openQRM-server]/openqrm

Default username and password after installation are :
User : openqrm
Password : openqrm

-> please change the default password immediately to prevent unauthorized access.
