openQRM

 Being pluggable in nature openQRM has a design that allows and enables developers to add features or plugins.  The enviroment is full of technologies and software that is discussed here.

PHP
 PHP5 enables the majority of openQRM in its web interface and in normal programing.  Additionally PHP runs along with Apache2, ADODB (MySQL, DB2, Oracle, or PostgreSQL) and a host of other technologies like XML, AJAX and more.

Base
 The base of openQRM describes the components that are required to run and offer the API to the plugins. The base is the infrastructure that allows the plugins to interact with the resources in openQRM. Local administration and the plugin management system are parts of the base.

Plugins
 Many plugins offer features and access to resources.  Some plugins offer monitoring, storage management, deployment or other service to the openQRM system. The list of plugins will change and grow faster than this document.  Please check the website for up to date information.

 To write a plugin you will need certian required and optional structures. 

 Required:

  base-directory
    base-dir/openqrm/plugins/[plugin-name]
    All plugins specific source code should go here.

  plugin etc directory
    base-dir/openqrm/plugins/[plugin-name]/etc
    All plugins specific configuration files should go here.

  plugin etc/init.d directory
    base-dir/openqrm/plugins/[plugin-name]/etc/init.d
    All plugins specific init scripts should go here.
    The plugins init script should be named "openqrm-plugin-[plugin-name]" and accept at least the start/stop parameters.
  
  plugins postinstall stage
    base-dir/openqrm/plugins/[plugin-name]/etc/init.d/openqrm-plugin-[plugin-name].postinstall
    This postinstall script must exist for packaging. It should run the commands needed for initialyzing the plugin after installation.
    (it does not enable the plugin but just prepare it so it could get enabled)

  plugins preremove stage
    base-dir/openqrm/plugins/[plugin-name]/etc/init.d/openqrm-plugin-[plugin-name].preremove
    This preremove script must exist for packaging. It should run the commands needed to stop and uninitialyze the plugin after installation.
    (it does not disable the plugin but just prepare it so it could get disabled)

  plugins configuration file
    base-dir/openqrm/plugins/[plugin-name]/etc/openqrm-plugin-[plugin-name].conf
    This main plugins configuration file must exists.
    It should set the following variables
     # plugin version
     OPENQRM_PLUGIN_VERSION="[openqrm-server-version]-[plugin-version]"
     # plugin dependencies for redhat-, suse- and debian-based systems
     OPENQRM_PLUGIN_DEPENDENCIES_REDHAT
     OPENQRM_PLUGIN_DEPENDENCIES_SUSE
     OPENQRM_PLUGIN_DEPENDENCIES_DEBIAN
     This OPENQRM_PLUGIN_DEPENDENCIES variables should be set to a comma-separated
     list of required components (dependencies) for redhat-, suse- and debian-based systems.

  plugins Makefile
    base-dir/openqrm/plugins/[plugin-name]/Makefile
    This Makefile compiles and packages the plugin. 
    It should implement the following targets
     configure, compile, install, uninstall, clean, realclean and all

 Optional:

  bin directory
   base-dir/openqrm/plugins/[plugin-name]/bin
   All plugins specific binaries should go here.

  plugin sbin directory
   base-dir/openqrm/plugins/[plugin-name]/sbin
   All plugins specific daemons/server-binaries should go here.

  plugin include directory
   base-dir/openqrm/plugins/[plugin-name]/include
   All plugins specific functions files should go here.
   The plugin specific functions files should be named "openqrm-plugin-[plugin-name]-functions" 

  plugin etc/templates directory
   base-dir/openqrm/plugins/[plugin-name]/etc/templates
   All plugins specific template files should go here.
   The plugins templates should be named "openqrm-plugin-[plugin-name]..."

   plugin web directory
    base-dir/openqrm/plugins/[plugin-name]/web
    All plugins specific web-pages should go here.
