HOWTO create openqrm RPM packages from SVN:

1. check out via svn

svn co https://openqrm.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/openqrm openqrm-4.3


2. create source archive

tar czf openqrm-4.3.tgz openqrm-4.3


3. prepare rpmbuild environment:

3.a SuSE

cp openqrm-4.3.tgz /usr/src/packages/SOURCES/

cp rpm/openqrm-suse.spec /usr/src/packages/SPECS/

3.b. RedHat/Centos

cp openqrm-4.3.tgz /usr/src/redhat/SOURCES/

cp rpm/openqrm-rh.spec /usr/src/redhat/SPECS/


4. build package

4.a SuSE

cd /usr/src/packages

rpmbuild -ba SPECS/openqrm-suse.spec

4.b RedHat/CentOS

cd /usr/src/redhat

rpmbuild -ba SPECS/openqrm-rh.spec


5. Finished.

You now have source and binary packages.

Source RPM packag is located in SRPMS directory.
Binary packages are located in RPMS/<$arch/


Hint: you will need an internet connection during make process!
OpenQRM still wants to download some other packages.
