The Perl License

For those of you that choose to use the GNU General Public License, my
interpretation of the GNU General Public License is that no Perl script
falls under the terms of the GPL unless you explicitly put said script
under the terms of the GPL yourself.

Furthermore, any object code linked with perl does not automatically fall
under the terms of the GPL, provided such object code only adds definitions
of subroutines and variables, and does not otherwise impair the resulting
interpreter from executing any standard Perl script. I consider linking in
C subroutines in this manner to be the moral equivalent of defining subroutines
in the Perl language itself. You may sell such an object file as proprietary
provided that you provide or offer to provide the Perl source, as specified by
the GNU General Public License. (This is merely an alternate way of specifying
input to the program.) You may also sell a binary produced by the dumping of a
running Perl script that belongs to you, provided that you provide or offer to
provide the Perl source as specified by the GPL. (The fact that a Perl
interpreter and your code are in the same binary file is, in this case, a form
of mere aggregation.)

This is my interpretation of the GPL. If you still have concerns or difficulties
understanding my intent, feel free to contact me. Of course, the Artistic License
spells all this out for your protection, so you may prefer to use that.
